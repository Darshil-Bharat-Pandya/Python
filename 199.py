# Best Practices for Using Conditional Statements.

# 1. Keep conditions simple and expressive for better readability.
# 2. Avoid deeply nested conditional blocks; refactor complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions.
# 3. Comment on complex conditions to clarify their purpose.
# 4. Prefer the ternary operator for simple conditional assignements.
# 5. Advanced Techniques:
# 7. Leveraging the any() and all() functions with conditions applied to iterables.
# 8. Employing conditional expressions within list comprehensions and generator expressions.
