# Python  Functions = They are the block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks togethar and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. 

# Types
# 1. Built-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use.
# 2. User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

def my_function():
    print("Hello From My Function !")
    
def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
    print("Hello %s, From My Function !, I wish you %s" %(username, greeting))
