# Difference between Lists and Tuples in Python.

# List =
# 1. Lists are mutable.
# 2. The implication of iterations is Time-consuming.
# 3. The List is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
# 4. Lists consume more memory.
# 5. Lists have several built-in methods.
# 6. Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur.

# Tuple =
# 1. Tuples are immutable.
# 2. The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster.
# 3. A Tuple data type is appropriate for accesing the elements.
# 4. Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list.
# 5. Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
# 6. Because tuples don't change they are far less error-phone.
