# Type Casting in Python 

# It is the method to convert the Python variable datatype into a certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users.

# There can be two types of Type Cating in Python:

# 1. Python Implicit Type Conversion
# 2. Python Explicit Type Conversion

# 2. Explicit Type Conversion in Python
# In this method, Python need user involvement to convert the variable data type into the required data type.

# Examples of Type Casting in Python.
# Mainly type casting can be done with these data type functions:
# Int(): Python Int() function take float or string as an argument and returns int type object.
# float(): Python float() function take int or string as an argument and return float type object.
# str(): Python str() function takes float or int as an argument and returns string type object.

# Python Convert Float to Int.
# Python Program.

# int variable
a = int(input("\nPlease Enter the value of a: "))

# typecast to float
n = float(a)

print(n)
print(type(n))
