# Python Functions = They are the block of statements that return the specific task. The ideas is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks togethar and make a function so that instead of writing a same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. It increases the code readability and also it increases the code reusability.

# Types of Functions in Python.

# 1. Built-in library function: These are the Standard functions in Python that are available to use.
# 2. User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

def fun():
    print("Welcome to GFG") 
    print(fun)
    return fun

fun()

def fun2():
    print("Good Morning Sir/Ma'am.")
    print(fun2)
    return fun2

fun2()
