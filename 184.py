# Comparision Operators in Python

# The Python Operators can be usd with various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, and more. In Python, comparision operators are used to compare the values of two operands (elements being compared). When comparing strings, the comparision is based on the alphabetical order of their characters (lexicographic order).

a = int(input("\nPlease Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Please Enter the value of b: "))

print("\n", a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a > b)
print(a < b)
print(a >= b)
print(a <= b)

print(1 < a < 10)
print(9 < b <=10)
print(5 != a > 4)
print(a < 10 < a*10 == 50)

print("\n")
