# Functions.

# What are Functions ? = Functions are the convienient way to divide our code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.

# Syntax: 
# block_head:
#       1st block line
#       2nd block line
#       ...

# Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1, argument2, ...). The keywords of block are "if", "for", and "while".

# Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name.

def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    # Code to be executed
    pass  # This is a placeholder and can be replaced by actual code
