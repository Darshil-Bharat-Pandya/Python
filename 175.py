# Set Data Type in Python = In Python Data Types, a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements. 

a = set()
print(a)
print(type(a))

b = set("GeeksForGeeks")
print(b)
print(type(a))

c= set([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, "Geeks", "For", "Geeks"])
print( c)
print(type(c))
