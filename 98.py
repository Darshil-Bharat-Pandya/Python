# Practice Question
# Write a Program in Python to input 2 int numbers, a and b. Print True if a is greater than or equal to b. If not print False.

# Entering the Values in two Variables a and b.
a = int(input("\nPlease Enter the Value of a: "))
b = int(input("\nPlease Enter the Value of b: "))

# The Logic and Conditions of this Program.
# If a is greater than or equal to b, then print "True".
if (a >= b):
    print("\n",True)
# If a is not greater than or equal to b, then print "False". 
else:
    print("\n",False)
