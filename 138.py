# Explain List, Tuple, Set and Dictionary

# 1. List

# It is a non-homogeneous data structure that stores the elements in columns of a single row or multiple rows.
# The list can be represented by []
# The list allows duplicate elements.
# The list can use nested among all.
# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# A list can be created using the list() function.
# A list is mutable i.e. we can make any changes in the list.
# List is ordered
# Creating an empty list l=[].

# 1. Tuple

# It is also a non-homogeneous data structure that stores the elements in columns of a single row or multiple rows.
# The tuple can be represented by ()
# The tuple allows duplicate elements.
# The tuple can use nested among all.
# Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# A tuple can be created using the tuple() function.
# A tuple is immutable i.e. we can not make any changes in the tuple.
# Tuple is ordered
# Creating an empty Tuple t=().

# 3. Set

# The set data structure is also a non-homogeneous data structure but stores the elements in a single row. 
# The set can be represented by {}
# The set will not allow duplicate elements.
# The set can use nested among all.
# Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# A set can be created using the set() function.
# A set is mutable i.e. we can make any changes in the set, its elements are not duplicated.
# Set is unordered
# Creating a set a=set() b=set(a)

# 4. Dictionary

# A dictionary is also a non-homogeneous data structure that stores key-calue pairs.
# The dictionary can be represented by {}
# The dictionary doesn't allow duplicate keys.
# The dictionary can use nested among all.
# Example: {1:"a", 2:"b", 3:"c", 4:"d", 5:"e"}
# A dictionary can be created using the dict() function.
# A dictionary is mutable its keys are not duplicated.
# Dictionary is ordered (Python 3.7 and above)
# Creating an empty dictionary d={}.
