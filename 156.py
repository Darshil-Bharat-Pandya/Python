# Python Data Types

# The Datatypes are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python Programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.

# The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:
# Numeric
# Sequence Type
# Boolean
# Set
# Dictionary
# Binary Types(memoryview, bytearray, bytes)

a = int(input("Please Enter the Value of a:"))
print("The Value Entered in a is:",a)
print("The Datatype of the Value entered in a is:",type(a))
