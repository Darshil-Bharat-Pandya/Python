# Types of Operators
# An Operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.

# Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
# Relational / Comparision Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) 
# Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, !=, %=, **=)
# Logical Operators (not, and, or)

# These Operators are widely used in Python.
